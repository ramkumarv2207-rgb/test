I am a motivated and curious learner with a strong interest in computer science and technology. I enjoy understanding how software and systems work, and I like solving logical and technical problems. I am continuously learning new concepts related to programming, artificial intelligence, and software development. My goal is to build practical skills and apply my knowledge to real-world problems while growing both personally and professionally.
